This is a somewhat useless Repository, it just contains some Java code written
to test out some of the main principles of the design patterns proposed by the
Gang of Fours. Not all the code is written by me, most of it is taken from the
excellent book "GoF's Design Patterns in Java" by "Franco Guidi Polanco", which
may be freely downloaded at: http://eii.ucv.cl/pers/guidi/designpatterns.htm .

I've just made some minor modifications where I thought they could have led up
to a better comprehension of the Design Pattern.

All the directories may be imported in Eclipse.
